# Verifier-Backed Micro-Specialists for Local Code Transformation

## Abstract

This note documents the current validated result behind the Lumina micro-specialist
demo. The central claim is narrow: for small, contract-specific code transformation
tasks, a verifier-backed specialist can outperform a general base model, and a
contract-specific confidence signal can support stable selective control. We test this
claim on three JavaScript loop refactor contracts: loop-to-`map`,
scalar-accumulator-to-`reduce`, and object-index-builder-to-`reduce`. Across all three,
contract-matched specialists improved pass rates over the base model and supported
stable thresholded acceptance policies. We then packaged the promoted specialists into a
local runtime that decomposes a prompt, routes transformable spans, verifies each
rewrite, applies threshold gating, and composes the final output. The result validates a
narrow architecture pattern for local code transformation, not universal confidence or
broad specialist routing. A newer public comparison surface (`public_eval_v2`) also
clarifies that the current strongest external claim is about verifier-gated selective
acceptance relative to prompt-only generation, not broad superiority over deterministic
rewriting.

## 1. Problem

Earlier Lumina work pursued broad specialists such as `math`, `code`, and `general`,
plus routing and confidence machinery on top. That approach did not produce strong
enough generator gains or reliable confidence behavior. The main issue was granularity:
the specialists were still too broad, the contracts were underspecified, and correctness
was often difficult to measure.

The micro-specialist program reframed the problem around very narrow tasks with hard
contracts:

- the task must be easy to detect
- the output format must be strict
- correctness must be executable or verifier-backed
- confidence must mean probability of correctness for that exact contract

This note records the result of that shift.

## 2. Hypothesis

We test three linked hypotheses:

1. A narrow verifier-backed specialist can materially outperform a general base model on
   an exact code transformation contract.
2. A confidence signal is meaningful when defined as contract-specific correctness
   likelihood rather than as a generic model score.
3. A local runtime can compose multiple such specialists into a single
   prompt-to-response flow with verification and fallback.

## 3. Experimental Setting

### 3.1 Task family

The task family is intentionally narrow: JavaScript loop refactoring. The promoted
contracts are:

- `js_array_loop_to_map`
- `js_reduce_accumulator_refactor`
- `js_reduce_object_index_builder`

Each contract requires one exact rewrite shape, one executable verifier, and one fixed
threshold policy.

### 3.2 Method

For each contract we used the same pattern:

1. define the contract and verifier
2. measure the base model on that contract
3. train a contract-matched answer uplift only if there is headroom
4. train a contract-specific confidence head only if the evaluation split contains both
   positives and negatives
5. select and freeze a threshold after stability checks

Key design choices:

- synthetic contract-matched datasets rather than generic code instruction data
- executable verifiers rather than text-overlap scoring
- adversarial `hard_val_v2` splits where needed to create meaningful negatives
- confidence trained only on mixed positive/negative contract data

### 3.3 Base and runtime

The research specialists were trained on top of a `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct`
family path. The packaged local runtime uses a single local Ollama backend
(`llama3.1:latest`) shaped like a shared-base system, but not yet true adapter swapping.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Contract-level answer uplift

Frozen answer-model results:

#### `js_array_loop_to_map`

- control pass rate: `0.797`
- treatment pass rate: `0.906`

#### `js_reduce_accumulator_refactor`

- control pass rate: `0.797`
- treatment pass rate: `1.000`

#### `js_reduce_object_index_builder`

- control pass rate: `0.641`
- treatment pass rate: `1.000`

Across all three contracts, a contract-matched uplift outperformed the base model.

### 4.2 Contract-specific confidence and selective control

Frozen control policies:

#### `js_array_loop_to_map`

- threshold: `0.30`
- coverage mean: `0.641`
- selective accuracy mean: `1.000`
- overall accuracy mean: `0.641`

#### `js_reduce_accumulator_refactor`

- threshold: `0.40`
- coverage mean: `0.898`
- selective accuracy mean: `1.000`
- overall accuracy mean: `0.898`

#### `js_reduce_object_index_builder`

- threshold: `0.50`
- coverage mean: `0.414`
- selective accuracy mean: `1.000`
- overall accuracy mean: `0.414`

These numbers should be read as high-precision selective transformation, not universal
task solving. Coverage matters. The object-index contract is the clearest case: it
reaches `1.000` selective accuracy only by being conservative at `0.414` coverage. The
important point is that the confidence signal was strong enough to support stable
selective acceptance on each exact contract once the training and evaluation data were
aligned.

### 4.3 Local runtime result

The packaged runtime takes a normal JavaScript refactor prompt, extracts transformable
spans, routes them to the three promoted specialists, verifies each output, applies
threshold gating, and composes the final code.

Validated local benchmark on Mac via Ollama (`llama3.1:latest`):

- iterations: `3`
- cold-stop-first: `true`
- final statuses: `completed`, `completed`, `completed`
- accepted counts: `3`, `3`, `3`
- mean total latency: `2678.38 ms`
- min total latency: `2160.63 ms`
- max total latency: `3290.43 ms`
- loaded model: `5.9 GB`, `100% GPU`, context `4096`

This validates the local runtime shape:

prompt -> span extraction -> routing -> specialist generation -> verification ->
threshold gate -> composition

It does not validate the final deployment architecture. The local demo currently runs
through a single Ollama backend and uses runtime heuristics shaped by the frozen
contracts rather than loading the persisted research heads directly.

### 4.4 Public comparison surface (`public_eval_v2`)

The repo now includes a runnable public comparison harness across three arms:

- `builder_only`
- `prompt_only`
- `runtime_gated`

Important comparison rule:

- `runtime_gated` applies thresholding to the same candidate emitted by `prompt_only`
- it is not allowed to take a second stochastic model sample

This makes the comparison easier to interpret: the runtime arm tests gating and
fallback, not a second chance to generate a different answer.

Current `public_eval_v2` snapshot:

- `js_array_loop_to_map`
- `builder_only`: pass `1.000` - `prompt_only`: pass `1.000` - `runtime_gated`: coverage
  `1.000`, selective accuracy `1.000`
- `js_reduce_accumulator_refactor`
- `builder_only`: pass `1.000` - `prompt_only`: pass `0.500` - `runtime_gated`: coverage
  `0.500`, selective accuracy `1.000`, overall accuracy `0.500`
- `js_reduce_object_index_builder`
- `builder_only`: pass `1.000` - `prompt_only`: pass `0.750` - `runtime_gated`: coverage
  `0.750`, selective accuracy `1.000`, overall accuracy `0.750`

What this public surface supports:

- deterministic contract logic is currently a very strong baseline
- prompt-only generation is weaker on some reduce/object-index rows
- runtime gating improves precision by refusing unsafe outputs
- runtime gating does not currently exceed deterministic rewriting on this slice

That is a narrower but more defensible public claim than the earlier internal framing.

### 4.5 Transfer calibration for persisted research heads

The first persisted research head wired into the standalone runtime was the archived
`js_reduce_object_index_builder` probe bundle. On the local Ollama public slice, that
raw head did not transfer cleanly: it was stricter than the heuristic runtime score and
reduced object-index coverage from `0.750` to `0.250` while keeping selective accuracy
at `1.000`.

We then fit a small transfer calibrator on a separate local object-index slice
(`examples/object_index_transfer_v1.jsonl`) using the same Ollama prompt path. That
calibrator combines the raw persisted probe score with the current heuristic runtime
score and is then re-applied to the fixed public slice.

Current object-index comparison on the fixed public slice:

- heuristic runtime
- coverage: `0.750` - selective accuracy: `1.000`
- raw persisted probe
- coverage: `0.250` - selective accuracy: `1.000`
- transfer-calibrated probe
- coverage: `0.750` - selective accuracy: `1.000`

The important point is not that the persisted head transfers cleanly as-is. It does not.
The important point is that the standalone runtime now has a concrete path for adapting
archived research heads to the local Ollama execution distribution without changing the
public eval matrix itself.

## 5. Main Findings

### 5.1 What is validated

- Narrow verifier-backed specialists can materially outperform a base model on precise
  code transformation contracts.
- Contract-matched target shape matters as much as model family.
- Contract-specific confidence can support stable selective control when it is trained
  on meaningful positives and negatives.
- A local runtime can compose several such specialists into one prompt-to-response flow.
- On the current public comparison surface, verifier-gated runtime behavior is most
  defensible as a precision/safety mechanism relative to prompt-only generation.

### 5.2 What is not validated

- universal confidence across tasks
- broad code competence
- the original broad multimodel arbitration thesis
- true shared-base adapter loading in the local runtime

These results are intentionally contract-specific.

## 6. Failure Modes and Lessons

Several failures were important in reaching the current result:

- broad specialists stayed weak because the contracts were too blurry
- generic code fine-tuning hurt execution performance when the training contract
  mismatched the runtime
- some contracts required adversarial evaluation splits before confidence was even
  meaningful
- output extraction and runtime contract details were often as important as training
  itself

The core lesson is that the unit of progress is not “a specialist model.” It is a full
contract: routing rule, prompt shape, output extraction, verifier, confidence signal,
and threshold policy.

## 7. Limitations

- The current specialist library is small: only three promoted contracts.
- The data is heavily synthetic and contract-shaped.
- The local runtime now supports loading one persisted research head directly
  (`js_reduce_object_index_builder`), but that head requires local transfer calibration
  on the Ollama path; transfer is not automatic.
- The local runtime is adapter-shaped in interface only; it is not yet a true
  adapter-swapping implementation.
- The evidence is currently limited to narrow JavaScript refactoring tasks.

## 8. Next Steps

The most valuable next step is not more blind specialist proliferation. It is tightening
the architecture gap between the validated research pattern and the local runtime:

1. replace the single-model local backend with true shared-base adapter loading
2. load persisted contract-specific confidence heads directly in the runtime
3. add one or two additional specialists only if they compose cleanly with the existing
   three
4. harden the local demo into a public-facing artifact without broadening the claims

## 9. Conclusion

The strongest conclusion is narrow but real:

For small verifier-backed code transformation contracts, micro-specialists with
contract-specific confidence are a workable local architecture pattern.

The current public evidence is best understood this way:

- deterministic rewriting is a strong baseline on narrow contracts
- prompt-only generation is weaker on some held-out reduce/object-index rows
- verifier-gated runtime behavior is valuable because it can reject unsafe outputs and
  preserve high precision on accepted rewrites

This is not a result about universal confidence or general modular intelligence. It is a
concrete result about how to build a local code system that can decide when a narrow
transformation is good enough to keep.
